Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in\nthis directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application\nis automatically handled by the following `MauiAsset` Build Action within your `.csproj`.\n\n	<MauiAsset Include="Resources\Raw\**" LogicalName="%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)" />\n\nThese files will be deployed with your package and will be accessible using Essentials:\n\n	async Task LoadMauiAsset()\n	{\n		using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");\n		using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);\n\n		var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();\n	}\n
